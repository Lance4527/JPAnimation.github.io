        <h1>Seinen</h1>

        <p class="overview">Some of us enjoy watching people getting slaughtered or other intense scenes. No judgment here, in fact, there's even a whole genre that's perfect for your twisted personality.</p>

        <h3 class="describe">Berserk</h3>

        <p class="describe">Depending on wether you watch the movies that were made to tell the story preceding the anime first you might miss some story but I'll summarize the movies and the anime. Guts is a mercenary who ends up joining the band of hawks under Griffith. After countless battles together and a budding friendship, Guts overhears a conversation of Griffith's that makes him yearn to be Griffith's equal. He leaves and during that time the Kingdom betrays the band of Hawks and Griffith is reduced to a shell of who he was. Guts comes back to save Griffith but shortly after Griffith sacrifices everyone in order to gain godlike power to regain what he lost. The anime continues the story of Guts in chase of Griffith for his betrayal.</p>

        <h3 class="describe">Parasyte - The Maxim</h3>

        <p class="describe">Shinichi awakens to find a strange parasyte attempting to control his body and cuts the circulation in his arm to prevent it from traveling any further. The parasyte eventually developes into a life form which he names Migi. In a world where these parasytes have taken over a lot of the population and then feed on humans, Shinichi and Migi both survive many tragedies and the lines between right, wrong, humans, and parasytes become blurred.</p>

        </figure>
        <h3 class="describe">Tokyo Ghoul</h3>

        <p class="describe">A timid boy named Kaneki and his only friend, Hide, are hanging out when Kaneki ends up getting the attention of a girl he finds attractive. Everything is great until she turns out to be a ghoul who seduced him so she could eat him. By complete chance she is killed and an emergency operation is performed with her organs in order to save Kaneki. Kaneki becomes a ghoul and struggles to maintain his humanity and bridge the gap between humans and ghouls, until he suffers unimaginable pain and suffering. </p>
