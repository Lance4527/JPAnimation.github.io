        <h1>Isekai Overview</h1>

        <p class="overview">At some point we may all have pondered what life was like living inside our favorite games or shows. Isekai is the embodiment of that notion. The protaganists enviroment ranges from a world where the outcome of a game decides every decision in life, to fighting to protect people as a summoned hero, but they always start in mediocre lives as a student or corporate employee. Here I've listed a few of the best.</p>

However, after failing to use any kind of magic, failing to rescue a child, and getting beat up in an alley, he then becomes very confused as to why he is even in this world. He follows a girl that saves him and develops some feelings and decides to help her no matter what. He then realizes what his power in this world is after he's killed and comes back to life in the previous day. </p>
